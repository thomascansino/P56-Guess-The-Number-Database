Hey there,

This is 5/5 project to complete the database course in freecodecamp and get the certificate.

Project Info:
- I created a script in Bash to guess a number from 1 to 1000
- I also made a database in PSQL to store:
    - usernames of player
    - number of games played per player
    - fewest guesses per player
    - history of all games (how many guesses it took per game & the username of the player)
 - I used Git for version control
